'''
Step 1 â€” loading the data, selecting your input and target columns, and preparing everything for modeling.
'''

'''

Concept	-> What It Means	-> How It Applies
Features (X) ->	Input data the model learns from	Sensor signals other than mag_1_c
Target (y) ->	What you want to predict	Clean signal: mag_1_c
Normalization (StandardScaler)	->  Adjust feature values to have mean 0, std 1	Makes training stable and fast
Train/test split	-> Split data into parts for training and evaluation	Helps test generalization of the model
Regression	-> Predicting a continuous value (not classification)	Your case: continuous magnetic signal
